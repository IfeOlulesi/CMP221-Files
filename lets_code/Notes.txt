What is Object Oriented Programming?
	- We use the object to display the properties of the object
	- Java said efritin in the world is an object
	- A class is a blueprint/template for creating objects
	- A class is an object constructor
	
	Functions in objects are called methods
	
	
Method
	This is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
	A method is a function inside a class
	
	
Class
	A class is a java program with methods and properties


Static Methods:
  these are methods that can be run without creating the object of the class

Non-Static Methods:
  these are methods that must be run with the object of the class

OOP

Inheritance

	whenever you use the super keyword, you are calling the constructor of the parent class
	and you must provide corresponding parameters as required by that constructor

	Purpose of inheritance is to reuse code


MODIFIERS
	These are keywords 


FINAL

	- When a class is final, it can never be inherited
	- When a function is defined final, it can never be over-ridden		


ABSTRACT 
  - An abstract class can inherit from an abstract class
  - It must have a child class- It must be inherited.



  - An abstract method is a method that must be implemented i.e. must be given a body


A final class can't be inherited -- must not be inherited


PACKAGES
  - A package is a folder
  - A package in java is used to group related classes
  - Used to avoid name conflict

  TYPES
  - User defined
  - Built-in packages
